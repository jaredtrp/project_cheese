# BREWHAUS
# Core functionality:
Discovery is one of the most tantalizing and rewarding aspects of exploring the vast world of beer, but we humans have an almost inevitable tendency to fall into patterns. With this shortcoming in mind, we developed this app to offer a random beer from BrewDog Brewery, but with the added feature of basing this output on the weather in the Austin, Texas area.

For any day where the weather is below 65 degrees fahrenheit, beers above 7.5 ABV are randomly recommended for their tendency to provide warmth.

## As a cheese enthusiast, I want to learn about cheeses so that I can maximize the experience. 

## When a user loads the site they see:
- Beer-themed design
- Brewhaus logo
- Tagline/quote
- Brief explanation of functionality
- Beer Me button (loads random beer)
- Random beer card including desired information about said beer

     - Grate it - collapses card - keeps card in array
